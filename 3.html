  <h2><strong>Trick 3: The Availability Heuristic</strong></h2>
  <p>
    This one can be summed up as throwing good money after bad. For reasons I cannot fathom, people will use the money they’ve already wasted on gambling as a justification for spending more money on the same exact failed enterprise. They’ll sit there and cry “I can’t let all that money I’ve already spent on this be for nothing!” and they’ll shovel more legal tender into the fire. Because they think the money’s not “lost” until they give up.

  <p>
    So, game designers, if you want to leverage this to sell more loot boxes, you gotta remind people how much they have spent without getting a good payoff. Show it right there on the screen. Red font. Bold red font. People will be more likely to keep paying until they win what they want.

  <p>
    And here’s a bonus bit of evil for you: The sunk cost effect happens most often when people feel like they can recoup their losses, like in a casino. If you really want to twist the knife –and I heartily recommend twisting knives at every opportunity– offer players a chance to win back 20% of their recent expenditures when they unbox something of legendary quality or whatever. They’ll spend way more money than they’ll ever get back.

  <p>
    But game designers, you could use this quirk to make loot boxes more compelling. When gamers open a box that doesn’t contain some legendary item they’re coveting, keep track! Remind them of how many loot boxes they have opened that did NOT contain an item of that quality. After a few tries, the gambler’s fallacy will kick in and they will think their odds of getting a legendary item will have gone up. It’s like free money! For you! Not them!
