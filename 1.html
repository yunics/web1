  <h2><strong>Trick 1: The Gambler’s Fallacy</strong></h2>
  <p>
    <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/g/gamblersfallacy.asp" target="_blank" title="Gambler's Fallacy Definition">Mortals</a> have this weird misconception about probabilities. If you toss a fair coin three times and happen to get three heads in a row, most humans will think that there’s a higher than normal chance of getting tails <u>on the next flip</u>. Because the coin is “due” to come up tails.Even though each flip is a separate event that always has a 50/50 chance of being heads or tails. You all crack me up.

  <p style="margin-top:50px;">But game designers, you could use this quirk to make loot boxes more compelling. When gamers open a box that doesn’t contain some legendary item they’re coveting, keep track! Remind them of how many loot boxes they have opened that did NOT contain an item of that quality. After a few tries, the gambler’s fallacy will kick in and they will think their odds of getting a legendary item will have gone up. It’s like free money! For you! Not them!\
